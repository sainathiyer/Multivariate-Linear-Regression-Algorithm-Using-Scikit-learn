# Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Algorithm-Using-Scikit-learn
This project deals with basic concepts of data science like dataset generation, exploratory data analysis, multivariate linear regression, gradient descent which can guide a novice data science explorer. Data set generation has always been an inquisitive part of any data science project. With massive availability of the high computing processors in the market, customers suffer from ‘Paradox of Choice’. This project focuses on prediction of price of processor based on various attributes like clock speed, cores and cache memory.
